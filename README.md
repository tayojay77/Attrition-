Attrition-Analysis

## Analysis on Employee Attrition Using SQL 

## Introduction 

This is a SQL (Structured Query Language) project for attrition. This project aims to delve deeply into the major factors resulting in employee attrition and explore how organizations can best mitigate these issues to improve the quality of life for every employee and increase employee retention rates.

As a diligent data analyst, I delved into the HR dataset on attrition, eager to unveil the stories embedded within the numbers. I delved into demographics, examining employees in age groups between 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 55+.

## Data Source 

The HR dataset was gotten from Kaggle.com. 

The dataset has 38 columns with 1480 records which comparises of EmmployeeID, Age, AgeGroup, Attrition, BussinessTravel, DailyRate, Department, DistanceFromHome, Education, EducationField, and many more.

## Data Cleaning 

To ensure data integrity and consistency, I had to clean the dataset by assigning the correct data type to every column. I ran a query to investigate duplicates in the employee_id and found that there were 10 duplicate rows, which I removed to ensure accurate analysis.. 

## Objective 

The purpose of this project is to analyze and uncover the stories embedded in the numbers within the HR dataset. It aims to extract useful information and insights to support decision-making on how employers and organizations can improve the quality of the work environment, prioritize employee welfare and mental health, and ultimately reduce attrition rates while increasing employee retention.
